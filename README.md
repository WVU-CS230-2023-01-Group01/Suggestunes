# Suggestunes
Suggestunes is a music suggestions app that allows you to find/play songs, create playlists of songs, and export those playlists to Spotify.

# Motivation
We wanted a music service that provides personalized suggestions for music, has a simple layout that is easy to understand and use, and has a heavy focus on playlist creation using the Spotify API

# Code Style
This project uses Angular, so we have tried our best to conform to the Angular coding style.

# Screenshots/Demo

# Framework Used
Angular TypeScript

# Features
* Suggests music based on your preferences
* Allows you to play songs in browser
* Allows you to create playlists of your favorite songs

# Code Example

# API Reference
* https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api
* https://cyanite.ai/

# How to Use?
New users can choose the "Sign Up" button from the landing page to create an account with their email. Once the account is created, you will be routed to the "Log In" page. Enter your email and password here and click "Login". This will route you to your account page, where you will see your username displayed. You can navigate to the profile pic in the navbar in the top right corner to change your username/password or your bio. You can also navigate to the "Songs" page to browse songs that have already been imported to the site. The main feature however is the "Playlists" page, where you can create playlists and search for songs to add to playlists. You can then play these songs in the site.
