# Suggestunes
Suggestunes is a music suggestions app that allows you to find/play songs, create playlists of songs, and export those playlists to Spotify.
* Link to Suggestunes: https://suggestoons-app.web.app/

# Motivation
We wanted a music service that provides personalized suggestions for music, has a simple layout that is easy to understand and use, and has a heavy focus on playlist creation using the Spotify API

# Code Style
This project uses Angular, so we have tried our best to conform to the Angular coding style.
